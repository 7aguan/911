The cultural significance behind the serpentine mascot
Snake-shaped lucky charms carry a wealth of symbolic meanings and cultural values in traditional Chinese culture. Here are some of the main cultural significances behind snake-shaped lucky charms:

1. Symbol of sanctity and auspiciousness
In ancient Chinese culture, snakes were regarded as symbols of deities and auspicious geomantic sites. Many myths and legends, such as those involving Fuxi and NÃ¼wa, are associated with snakes and revered by people. Moreover, due to their resemblance in appearance, snakes are also considered representatives of dragons. In Chinese culture, snakes are generally seen as auspicious symbols, representing deities and wealth.

2. Implications of wealth and longevity
In ancient Chinese feng shui, snakes were revered as symbols of wealth and auspiciousness. The saying goes, "Snakes do not enter places without fortune," meaning that when people are building houses for the living or the dead and find snakes on the ground, they believe the feng shui is extremely good, suitable for constructing a residence, and will bring great wealth, prosperity, and good fortune in the future. Moreover, snakes are also associated with health and longevity.

3. Symbol of Wisdom and Mystery
In ancient cultures, snakes were regarded as possessing mysterious power and represented wisdom, calmness, silence, and cunning. These contradictory symbols made snakes play an important role in culture. Lucky charms of snakes, such as dragon snakes and jade snakes, not only have the symbolic meaning of snakes but also imply wisdom and mystery.

4. The ability to protect and heal
Snakes are believed to have strong protective and healing powers in folk beliefs and culture. These abilities make snakes irreplaceable in traditional culture. People believe that snakes can dispel evil and protect families from harm.

5. Symbol of vitality and reproductive power
In some ancient tribes, such as the Dongyi tribe, snakes were regarded as symbols of eternal life. Snakes possess a tenacious vitality and vigorous reproductive power, neither dying nor remaining lifeless, which are characteristics that people see as a symbol of vitality.

6. The ideal of wishing for the continued prosperity of the clan.
The snake-shaped mascot is not only a worship of the snake itself, but also an "instinctive ideal for the continuation of the clan" that the world relies on. The connotation of wishing for the continuation of life in the worship of the snake totem, through the display of this totemic image and the ingenious combination of traditional auspicious patterns, has become a symbol of the eternal vitality of national culture.

In summary, snake-shaped lucky charms hold multiple symbolic meanings in Chinese culture, encompassing aspects such as holiness, auspiciousness, wealth, longevity, wisdom, protection, and vitality. These symbolic meanings reflect the ancients' awe and worship of snakes, as well as their yearning for a better life.
